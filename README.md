# Hangman-Game
week 3 HW

Jordan's Hangman Game.

Bonus: Plays an applause when the user wins a point, and a womp when the user loses (but losing does not remove a point, the game is not punitive).

The user starts with 10 guesses per word, and loses one guess for each incorrect letter.

Bonus: I added hints for the user, each hint is matched to each answer.
